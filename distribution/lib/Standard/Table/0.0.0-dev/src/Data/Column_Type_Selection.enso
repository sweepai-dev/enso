## The type representing inferring the column type automatically based on values
   present in the column.

   The most specific type which is valid for all values in a column is chosen:
   - if all values are integers, `Integer` is chosen,
   - if all values are decimals or integers, `Decimal` is chosen,
   - if all values are booleans, `Boolean` is chosen,
   - if the values are all the same time type (a date, a time or a date-time),
     the corresponding type is chosen, `Date`, `Time_Of_Day` or `Date_Time`,
     respectively,
   - otherwise, `Text` is chosen as a fallback and the column is kept as-is
     without parsing.
